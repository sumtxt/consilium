\title{Computes Bayes Factor of Two Partial M-Probit Models}
\usage{
BayesFactor(m1, m2, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m1}{(required) partial m-probit model 1 estimated with chib95=TRUE}

\item{m2}{(required) partial m-probit model 2 estimated with chib95=TRUE}

\item{log}{report BayesFactor on log-scale?}
}
\value{
A scalar estimate of the Bayes factor.
}
\description{
\code{BayesFactor} computes the Bayes factor given two partial m-probit posteriors for which a marginal likelihood has been computed.
